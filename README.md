## How to use
[Please go to the prototype of our Viz system by clicking on this link.](https://hendricks27.github.io/CSE557/web/index.html)

The visualization system we developed aimed to show the car movement traces with the functions to a) choose the timeframe of interest, b) choose the employees of interest, and c) play/pause/fast forward/rewind both automatedly and on-demand. 

### Timeframe Options
On the top of the prototype website, there are four text boxes to fill in the dates and hours for the beginning and the end of the timeframe of interest.

### Employee Options
On the right panel of the website, there are department-wise checkboxes to select the employees of interest.
By hovering the mouse over the names, employees' job titles will appear in the mouseover text.

### Start of visualization
There is a 'Start' button on the top of the website.

By clicking on the button, the timer will appear on the right upper corner of the map to indicate the current timestamp.

Colors assigned for the chosen employees will be updated on the right panel before their names.

A filled circle with a shallower tail show the location of current timestamp and the location in the previous 5 minutes.

### Play/pause/fast forward/rewind functions
When hoping to pause/restart or fast forward/rewind, there are three buttons on top for these functions.

When there are no car movement traces available in the hour, there will be a text reminding users of the automated fast forward.
